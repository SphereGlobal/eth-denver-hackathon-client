This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# AI Intent Layer for Blockchain Interaction

The AI Intent Layer is an innovative interface designed to bridge the gap between natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and blockchain technology. It leverages advanced AI algorithms to interpret human commands or queries expressed in natural language and translates them into actionable blockchain operations. This layer functions as an intermediary, enabling users without deep technical knowledge of blockchain technologies to interact with various blockchain networks and smart contracts effortlessly.

## Features:

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Parses and understands user intents from natural language inputs.
- **Command Mapping**: Translates recognized intents into specific blockchain actions, such as executing smart contract functions or querying blockchain data.
- **Blockchain Agnosticism**: Designed to interact with multiple blockchain platforms, providing a flexible interface for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and others.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensures secure interaction with blockchain networks, incorporating best practices for privacy and data protection.
- **Ease of Integration**: Can be integrated into existing applications, offering blockchain capabilities through conversational interfaces like chatbots or voice assistants.

## Use Cases:

- **Financial Transactions**: Users can send or receive cryptocurrency through simple commands like "Send 1 ETH to John."
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Facilitates interaction with smart contracts, allowing users to trigger contract functions through natural language, e.g., "Stake 50 tokens in the ABC pool."
- **Data Queries**: Enables querying blockchain data, such as account balances or transaction histories, using conversational language.

This layer democratizes access to blockchain technology, making it accessible to a broader audience through the simplicity of natural language.
